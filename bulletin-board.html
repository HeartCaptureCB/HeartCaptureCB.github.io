                    When it comes to confessing, location is of utmost importance! You wouldn’t go out with someone who asked you on a date in the bathroom, would you? A romantic location can really boost your chances, so choose wisely! Haku-chan recommends the school gardens, where the cherry blossom trees create a beautiful atmosphere ideal for confessions of love.

                Recently I’ve become quite enamoured with someone here at school, but I’m almost certain they have no idea who I am! How do I make a good first impression?

                  A: Dear Anon,

                  There are plenty of opportunities to connect with someone at school, from joining the same club to just hanging out. But if you’re looking for an impressive, memorable first impression, you’ll get your chance soon. The Aigasaki Academy Talent Show will be taking place in a couple months’ time - a perfect opportunity to <b>showcase your talents</b> to the person you admire and earn their respect. If you want, you could even dedicate your performance to them by <b>including things you know they like</b> to create an even better impression on them. I hope to see you there - not that I know who you are, of course ;)

                  The senpai I’ve liked since forever will be graduating next year, but I still don’t know whether to make a move or not! We’re friends, but I’m not sure we’re close enough, or how to tell her. I don’t have much time left… can you help? - Lily.

                  We all struggle with being honest, so you’re not alone! You’re right that you don’t have long, but there’s still plenty of time left, so there’s no need to rush. I think the best thing to do is for you to be honest and tell her directly. Clear communication helps avoid misunderstandings for both parties! Take time to prepare yourself, and do it as soon as possible so you’ll have less regrets.
