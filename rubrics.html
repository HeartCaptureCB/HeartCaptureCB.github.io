            <p class="animated-element text-size-16 slow margin-bottom-10">
              The affection system is here to help you gauge a particular capture target’s fondness 
              towards you via affection points. The more points you have, the more likely they will 
              respond positively to you and your advances. Affection points will not affect your entry’s 
              score whatsoever, it is purely for obtaining <a class="text-strong" href="/items.html">items</a> and story purposes. 
            </p>
            <p class="animated-element text-size-16 slow margin-bottom-10">
              During entry submission you will be asked which capture target you wish to pursue. 
              You may only choose one character and you will only gain or lose affection with that 
              character. You can switch your target in the next chapter, but we strongly advise 
              against it. Should you choose to switch, the affection points you gained from the 
              previous chapter will not carry over.
            </p>
            <p class="animated-element text-size-16 slow margin-bottom-10">            
              You can gain affection points from your chosen capture target in 3 ways:
            </p>
            <ul class="margin-bottom-10">
              <li>Incorporating one of the capture target’s likes into your entry </li>
              <li>Completing secret missions found in the <a class="text-strong" href="/quests.html">QUESTS</a> tab</li>
              <li>Participating in twitter events. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="animated-element text-size-16 slow margin-bottom-10">            
              However, do take caution while trying to gain affection points. Accidentally including 
              a dislike in your entry; taking on the wrong missions; or selecting the wrong answer 
              during the twitter events may result in a loss of affection. Be sure to get to know 
              your capture target well over in lore and character bios if you wish to win them over 
              and receive a good ending.
